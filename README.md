# Harvard Medical School - Harmful Brain Activity Classification

This repository contains code from our participation (Ketan Jaltare and Fabien Pavy) in the **Harvard Medical School - Harmful Brain Activity Classification** competition hosted on Kaggle.

The goal of the competition was to **detect and classify seizures and other types of harmful brain activity** from EEG recordings obtained from critically ill patients.

## Contents

The repository includes Kaggle notebooks that:

- Use a combination of libraries such as **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **PyTorch**, **Pandas**, and **Polars**
- Perform feature extraction from EEG data
- Fit and evaluate various classification models, including:
  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient boosted trees

## Notes

- The code was adapted specifically for the competition setting on Kaggle.
- Some scripts may require adjustment if used outside of the Kaggle environment.
